== Warnings ==

These steps are intended for people who are happy hacking around files.  There is no front-end interface for doing this.

  You will either need the free property list editor that comes with the Apple Developer Tools, or you can edit the raw XML, or you can find another plist editor somewhere.

= How to create a custom format =

  First you must download the [http://itivo.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/www/blankformat.plist blankformat.plist] file (right click and save as).  In your homedir, create the `Library/Preferences/iTiVo/formats/` directory, and place the blankformat.plist there, naming it anything you like.

  Edit it with the plist editor (double clicking should do it).

  Save it in the directory you created.

  Re-start iTiVo
