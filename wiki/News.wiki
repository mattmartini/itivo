Put a new test image that has a fix for issue 196.  In the previous test image, I tried to build a new mencoder, but didn't realize that the version was dynamically linked.  This works fine on my system, but not on anyone else's.  Replaced it with the previous version of mencoder.

Added a developer to the team.  Tony1athome is an experienced developer and longtime TiVo addict, but a complete newbie to Applescript.  Put up a test image that has a fix for issue 129 (bad episode name when running the queue).  Your feedback is welcome, and your patience is appreciated.  Better yet, more help would be welcome.
