  # My program crashes / I get 'mencoder' errors / I get tivodecode errors
    iTiVo is actually a front-end for several programs written by multiple people.  Many of these programs are not perfect (and iTiVo has its own bugs).  If you report bugs in the interface above (under Issues), I will hopefully get around to fixing it.  However, it may be related to underlying programs which I have no control over. The short version:  sorry.
  # This program is buggy!
    I only have a tivo 3 and an intel iMac running Leopard to test with.  I appreciate bug reports.
  # I clicked "subscribe" but it's not downloading all episodes of CSI!
    Subscribing only downloads 'future' episodes that show up on the tivo AFTER you started the subscription.  If you want to download all the CSI's currently on your tivo, select the table column heading 'show' (to sort all shows by name), find the first CSI and click on it.  Find the last CSI and shift-click on it.   Then select "Add Shows to Queue"
  # How do I get "The Daily Show" onto my iPhone automatically?
    Read the documentation at http://code.google.com/p/itivo/wiki/Subscriptions
  # I have questions about my TiVo.
    I'm only responsible for this front-end.  If you have questions about your tivo, I highly recommend going to the tivocommunity forum here: http://tivocommunity.com/tivo-vb/index.php
  # I have shows on my TiVo that are not listed on iTiVo!
    Certain shows and certain channels can be marked 'copyrighted'.  Any show marked as such is not available for download from the tivo, and is therefore not listed.
  # I managed to hide the Show Description drawer
    To unhide the show description drawer, click the little triangle on the top right of the main window.
  # I chose a download format and Quicktime will not play my video
    Some formats are not inteded for playing on your computer, and quicktime is unable to play them.  Read the later subsection about download formats for advice.
  # Is it supposed to be *this* slow?
    Several things affect the speed of the download:
    * Model of Tivo.  S3 is fastest, then HD then S2.
    * Size of the original program on the tivo (the more there is to transfer, the slower it will be).
    * The speed of your computer.  Your CPU is used to convert the movies once they get to the computer.
    * Format you are converting to.  The high resolution, high quality formats take a lot of processing power from your computer.
    * The quality of your Tivo->computer network.  Wired 100Mbps will not be fully utilized, but is your best connection.  Wireless will slow it down somewhat.
    Over a wired connection, from a TiVo S3, converting to iPhone, I can usually get a 1000 megabyte 30 minute show down in about 20 mins. Use those settings as a starting point to see.  If you're seeing MUCH worse times, then something is wrong.

== Download Formats ==
  # I want the original mpeg-2 from the tivo.
    The tivo stores its movies as an mpeg-2 transport stream (TS).  It also encrypts it.  If you want to see the unencrypted transport stream, choose the 'No Encode' format.  However, keep in mind that quicktime can't play such a file.  You will need to install [http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-macosx.html VLC] or [http://mplayerosx.sourceforge.net/ MplayerOSX] to view it.
  # I want the original mpeg-2 but without commercials.
    MPEG2-TS will cut up the file appropriately.  However, you will most likely end up with horrible audio/video sync issues.
  # What is iphone super-res?
    The iphone can play movies up to 640x480, although its display is only 480x320.  You can hook up a video cable to hook up your iphone to a TV, and that's the main reason for super-res..  It also uses a much higher bitrate for people who think the iphone setting isn't of a high enough quality.
  # Audio-only?
    The audio only re-encodes the video stream, throwing away ALL the movie, and just keeping the soundtrack.  Useful for people who plan on listening but not viewing, as it takes up a LOT less memory, and uses less battery life to play back.
  # PSP ?
    Connect your PSP via usb or insert the memory stick into a reader. Create a folder named "VIDEO" at the toplevel, and copy the movie into it.  Your PSP will now play your movie for you.
  # I want to keep my movies as a library on my hard drive... What settings?
    I'd personally use H.264 at 5mbps.  But this is all personal choice.  You can edit the settings to your heart's content.
  # I chose the right download format but it's not working.
    Submit a bug report under 'Issues' above.  Keep in mind I don't have all these devices, so I appreciate any encoder suggestions you may have.

== Tips and Tricks ==
  #  I have it automatically add it to itunes, and itunes manages my library.  So every time the download finishes, I have two copies of the movie.. one in the download location, and one in the iTunes library!!  HELP!!
    Go to your advanced preferences, and under *run when download completes* put:
{{{
  rm -f $file
